    Match centers of the locations of FPN feature with a set of GT bounding

    feature map location, we must supervise it with an appropriate GT box.
    There are multiple GT boxes in image, so FCOS has a set of heuristics to
    assign centers with GT, which we implement here.

            integer value giving the stride of corresponding FPN level.

    Compute distances from feature locations to GT box edges. These distances

    These deltas are used as targets for training FCOS to perform box regression
    and centerness regression. They must be "normalized" by the stride of FPN
    feature map (from which feature locations were computed, see the function
    `get_fpn_location_coords`). If GT boxes are "background", then deltas must
    be `(-1, -1, -1, -1)`.

    NOTE: This transformation function should not require GT class label. Your
